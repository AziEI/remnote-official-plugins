## Features

- Highlight words to automatically lookup the definition.
- Easily add definitions into your knowledge base.

## How to Use

Highlight a word to open the selected text menu. Click on the plugin button and select the dictionary tab.

The plugin will search for available definitions for the selected word. You can choose to save definitions to your knowledge base by clicking the save button next to each definition.

Definitions will get added under a Rem which you can specify using the "Dictionary Root Rem" setting. Note that this must be a top level Rem otherwise the plugin won't be able to find it.
